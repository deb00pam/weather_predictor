# WeatherWise - Intelligent Weather Prediction System

## 🌤️ Overview
WeatherWise is an AI-powered weather risk assessment platform that provides **activity-specific** weather predictions for outdoor planning. Instead of generic weather forecasts, it tells you the likelihood of adverse conditions for your specific activity (hiking, fishing, camping, etc.).

## 🎯 Problem Statement (Hackathon)
*"If you're planning an outdoor event—like a vacation, a hike on a trail, or fishing on a lake—it would be good to know the chances of adverse weather for the time and location you are considering."*

## ✅ Current Status - Python Backend with Database COMPLETE

### 📊 What's Working
- ✅ **Weather Data Processing**: Enhanced ML pipeline with 5 weather classifications
- ✅ **Machine Learning Models**: Trained classifiers stored in database (not pickle files)
- ✅ **FastAPI Backend**: REST API with activity-specific risk assessment
- ✅ **Database Integration**: SQLite database for model storage, caching, and analytics
- ✅ **Activity Profiles**: Customized risk weights for different activities
- ✅ **Performance**: ~2 second response times with ML predictions and caching
- ✅ **Analytics**: Query logging and performance tracking

### 🔮 Weather Classifications
- **Very Hot**: Temperature extremes affecting comfort
- **Very Cold**: Low temperatures impacting safety
- **Very Wet**: Heavy rainfall conditions  
- **Very Windy**: High wind speeds affecting activities
- **Very Uncomfortable**: Heat index-based discomfort levels

### 🎯 Activity Types Supported
- **Hiking/Trekking**: Prioritizes temperature extremes and trail conditions
- **Fishing**: Emphasizes wind conditions and water safety
- **Camping**: Focuses on overnight temperature and weather protection
- **Outdoor Sports**: Balances performance and safety factors
- **Beach/Vacation**: Optimized for recreational activities
